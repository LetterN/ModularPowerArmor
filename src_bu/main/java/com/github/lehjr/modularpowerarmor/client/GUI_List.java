       GuiTinkerTable(player, x, y, z);
       --------------------------------
       Most complex because it deals with all the slots in the player inventory
           plus all the slots in the modular items
           plus all the possible modules

       GuiFieldTinker(player);
      ----------------------------------
      should be the same as the regular tinker table GUI


       KeyConfigGui(player, x, y, z);
       ------------------------------
       doesnt seem to need much of anything...


     CosmeticGui(player, x, y, z);
     -----------------------------------
     only needs player container and the items that have the cosmetic capability

    PortableCraftingGui(player, world, new BlockPos(x, y, z));
    ----------------------------------------------------------




    GuiModeSelector(player);
    -----------------------------------
    needs player inventory and mode selector container
    hand is always the main hand, if not skip it in the request
